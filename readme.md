Exercise on HTML debugging (with git practice, too) per https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/debugging-html/debug-example.html:
* Fork this git repository to your own github account for debugging practice (https://github.com/ccsu-te350/debugging-html)
* Use git to clone down the forked repository to a directory on your local machine
* Find the debugging html section (open and work with debug-example.html)
* Work through fixing the example html file (note types of issues in our class slides - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O6tUmWSASJBosDxJa4D88FpQVWN9ClslIYR4nLC753U/edit?usp=sharing)
* Test your revised html against the W3 Validator at https://validator.w3.org/
* Keep fixing any remaining issues, until your html validates
* Remember to commit for every change you notice and fix with an appropriate message
* Remember to push changes upstream to your github account
